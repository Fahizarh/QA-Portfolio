### 🌐 Frontend Projects

#### 💡 **Fun fact:**  
Before focusing fully on Quality Assurance, I spent time building frontend projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This background helps me test UI behavior more effectively, spot visual bugs faster, and collaborate better with frontend developers.

Below are frontend projects I built using **HTML and CSS**, demonstrating my understanding of UI structure, styling, and responsive design.
